# My Portfolio
## Description

Welcome! The purpose of this portfolio is to give an overview of who I am as a front end developer and to demonstrate some of my skills and capabilities.

_Due to the nature of promotional advertising, many of the websites I build are short-lived. A large number of my past projects are currently expired or in development so I am unable to provide live examples of those projects. In addition to the projects listed, please consider this website and [dyla.dev](http://dyla.dev) as small examples of what I am capable of._
