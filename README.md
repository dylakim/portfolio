# My Portfolio
## Description

Welcome! The purpose of this portfolio website is to give an overview of who I am as a web developer and to demonstrate some of my abilities.

_Due to the nature of promotional advertising, the websites I build are short-lived. At this time, all of my projects are currently expired or in development so I am unable to provide any live examples of work. I apologize for the inconvenience. I wish there was more to see here...ðŸ™ƒ. Please consider this website and [dyla.dev](http://dyla.dev) small examples of what I am capable of._
